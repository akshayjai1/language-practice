/*
there is a set which contains all positive integers,
we can do popSmallest and it should pop, smallest number
we can do addBack(n) ==> this should add back the number, if it was popped. because if it was not popped, it is already in the set.

so we are keeping current variable, which points to current minimum,
and set, which contains list of added back elements.
